//GAME SERVER
/*
- Recieve Updates from all clients
- pack everything into one packet and distrbute it to all clients

- keep track of the clients - use list, array, vector of clients
- update interval 100ms
	- the bigger interval, more interpolation your client has to do, have to do more prediction
	- in our games it can be a variable so users can change it

-Client Connects
	-create a thread
-Server sends the update
	go through list of clients adn send update packet to each client in that list

- we're going to having multiple threads and the update buffer is going to be shared by all the threads
	- this is going to be out shared resource and we're going to have to syncronize the use of this resource
	- we can't have 2 thread writing to it at the same time
		- do this by using mutex objects
		- buffer will be a mutex object
